# Roleprinter
Roleprinter is a small tool to print out Item-Cards for
Paper-And-Pen-Roleplaying Games like Pathfinder or D&D.

In my games I handle Items via small, playing-card-sized pieces of paper
which fit into trading card pocket pages.

Since I am lazy I wrote this program to generate them for me.

The items which are present in the `items` folder are based on items from
the Pathfinder-RPG and licensed under the
[Open-Game-License](OpenGameLicense.txt)

Don't confuse that License with the License of this program, which is
